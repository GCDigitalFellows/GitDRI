# Git

Git is a powerful version control system used to save the state of files and folders, work with collaborators remotely, and pull in code from open source repositories. Git is a version control system, and its most important function is to save snapshots of the files present in a project folder, called a repository. Git repositories can be pushed and pulled to and from the cloud, allowing you to work on complex projects without interfering with the contributions of your collaborators. Git, and the online service GitHub, are largely responsible for the current upswing in open source contributions, and the tool substantially reduces the risk and friction that comes with working on large or complex projects.
