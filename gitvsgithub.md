# Git vs. GitHub

So what’s the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is a tool that is used on your local computer to track and back up files, especially code. It follows the various iterations of a project as “versions”—think of the version numbers of software as it is updated. GitHub, on the other hand, is a website that provides repositories and resources for storing code remotely. There are other version control systems (such as Mercurial) and hosting services (such as BitBucket), but Git and GitHub are currently the most popular.

If you haven't already, register for a GitHub accoutn [here](https://github.com/join). On GitHub, you can create an unlimited numver of public repositories for free. However, you must pay for private repositories. (If you're a teacher, you can apply for unlimited free private repositories [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/new).)
